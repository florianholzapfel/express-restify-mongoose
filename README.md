## Getting started

In your shell, install with npm:

var express = require('express');
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
var Schema = mongoose.Schema;
var restify = require('express-restify-mongoose')

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/database');

var Customer = new Schema({
	name: { type: String, required: true },
	comment: { type: String }
});
var CustomerModel = mongoose.model('Customer', Customer);

var Invoice = new Schema({
    customer: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Customer' },
	amount: { type: Number, required: true }
});
var InvoiceModel = mongoose.model('Invoice', Invoice);

var app = express();
app.configure(function(){
	app.use(express.bodyParser());
	app.use(express.methodOverride());
	restify.serve(app, CustomerModel);
	restify.serve(app, InvoiceModel);
});

http.createServer(app).listen(3000, function() {
	console.log("Express server listening on port 3000");
});
